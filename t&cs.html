</p>

<h4>10. Accounts</h4>
<p>
  10.1 In order to procure Services on this Website and to use certain other parts of the System, you may be required to create an Account which will contain certain personal details and Payment Information. This information may vary based upon your use of the Website as We may not require payment information until you wish to make a purchase. By continuing to use this Website, you represent and warrant that:
</p>
<ol type="10.1">
  <li>10.1.1 All information you submit is accurate and truthful.</li>
  <li>10.1.2 You have permission to submit Payment Information where permission may be required.</li>
  <li>10.1.3 You will keep this information accurate and up-to-date. Your creation of an Account is further affirmation of your representation and warranty.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  10.2 It is recommended that you do not share your Account details, particularly your username and password. We accept no liability for any losses or damages incurred as a result of your Account details being shared by you. If you use a shared computer, it is recommended that you do not save your Account details in your internet browser.
</p>
<p>
  10.3 If you have reason to believe that your Account details have been obtained by another person without consent, you should contact Us immediately to suspend your Account and cancel any unauthorised orders or payments that may be pending. Please be aware that orders or payments can only be cancelled up until provision of Services has commenced. In the event that an unauthorised provision commences prior to your notifying Us of the unauthorised nature of the order or payment, then you shall be charged for the period from the commencement of the provision of services until the date you notified us and may be charged for a billing cycle of one month.
</p>
<p>
  10.4 When choosing your username, you are required to adhere to the terms set out above in Clause 9. Any failure to do so could result in the suspension and/or deletion of your Account.
</p>

<h4>11. Termination and Cancellation of Accounts</h4>
<p>
  11.1 Either 2Ways Consultancy or you may terminate your Account. If We terminate your Account, you will be notified by email and an explanation for the termination will be provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to terminate without giving reasons.
</p>
<p>
  11.2 If We terminate your Account:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>11.2.1 Any current or pending orders or payments on your Account will be cancelled; and</li>
  <li>11.2.2 Provision of Services will not commence.</li>
</ul>

<h4>12. Services, Pricing and Availability</h4>
<p>
  12.1 Whilst every effort has been made to ensure that all general descriptions of Services available from 2Ways Consultancy correspond to the actual Services that will be provided to you, we are not responsible for any variations from these descriptions as the exact nature of the Services may vary depending on your individual requirements and circumstances. This does not exclude Our liability for mistakes due to negligence on Our part and refers only to variations of the correct Services, not different Services altogether. Please refer to sub-Clause 13.8 for incorrect Services.
</p>
<p>
  12.2 Where appropriate, you may be required to select the required Plan of Services or agree to a specific proposal.
</p>
<p>
  12.3 We neither represent nor warrant that such Services will always be available and cannot necessarily confirm availability until confirming your Order. Availability indications are not provided on the Website.
</p>
<p>
  12.4 All pricing information on the Website is correct at the time of going online. We reserve the right to change prices and alter or remove any special offers from time to time and as necessary.
</p>
<p>
  12.5 In the event that prices are changed during the period between an order being placed for Services and Us processing that order and taking payment, then the price that was valid at the time of the order shall be used.
</p>

<h4>13. Orders and Provision of Services</h4>
<p>
  13.1 No part of this Website constitutes a contractual offer capable of acceptance. Your order constitutes a contractual offer that We may, at Our sole discretion, accept. Our acceptance is indicated by Us sending to you an order confirmation email or a signed service agreement. Only once We have sent you an order confirmation email or a signed service agreement will there be a binding contract between 2Ways Consultancy and you.
</p>
<p>
  13.2 Order confirmations under sub-Clause 13.1 will be sent to you before the Services begin and shall contain the following information:
</p>
<ol type="13.2">
  <li>13.2.1 Confirmation of the Services ordered including full details of the main characteristics of those Services;</li>
  <li>13.2.2 Fully itemised pricing for the Services ordered including, where appropriate, taxes (e.g., GST), and other additional charges;</li>
  <li>13.2.3 Relevant times and dates for the provision of the Services;</li>
  <li>13.2.4 User credentials and relevant information for accessing those services, if applicable.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  13.3 If We, for any reason, do not accept your order, no payment shall be taken under normal circumstances. In any event, any sums paid by you in relation to that order will be refunded within 14 calendar days.
</p>
<p>
  13.4 Payment for the Services shall be taken via your chosen payment method, immediately for any agreed upfront fees and/or as per the payment schedule outlined in your order confirmation or service agreement.
</p>
<p>
  13.5 We aim to fulfil your Order within a reasonable period following your Order, unless there are exceptional circumstances. If we cannot fulfil your Order within a reasonable period, we will inform you at the time you place the Order by a note on the relevant web page or by contacting you directly after you place your Order. Time is not of the essence of the Contract, which means we will aim to fulfil your Order within any agreed timescales, but this is not an essential term of the Contract, and we will not be liable to you if we do not do so. If the Services are to begin within 14 calendar days of Our acceptance of your order, at your express request, you will be required to expressly acknowledge that any statutory cancellation rights will be affected.
</p>
<p>
  13.6 2Ways Consultancy shall use all Our reasonable endeavours to provide the Services with reasonable skill and care, commensurate with best industry practice.
</p>
<p>
  13.7 In the event that Services are provided that are not in conformity with your order and thus incorrect, you should contact Us immediately to inform Us of the mistake. We will ensure that any necessary corrections are made within a reasonable timeframe.
</p>
<p>
  13.8 Additional terms and conditions may apply to the provision of certain Services (e.g., specific project agreements, consulting contracts). You will be asked to read and confirm your acceptance of any such terms and conditions when completing your Order or prior to the commencement of those Services.
</p>
<p>
  13.9 2Ways Consultancy provides technical support via our online support forum, email, and/or phone as specified in your service agreement. 2Ways Consultancy makes every effort possible to respond in a timely manner but we do not guarantee a particular response time.
